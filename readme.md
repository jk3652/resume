## Research Interests
I am interested in exploring the applicability and effectiveness of geochemical proxies in studying past climate variability and the mechanisms behind them. Specifically, my research focuses on recontructing changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) in the North Atlantic, using neodymium isotope ratios (ÎµNd) as a water mass tracer. My research aims to study changes in the Earth's deep ocean circulation system and how they are tied to past climate changes and major events such as the Mid-Pleistocene Transition. Another goal of my research is to establish reliable constraints on the composition of the North Atlantic Deep Water throughout time, to provide an improved AMOC end-member reference for paleoceagraphic studies.
